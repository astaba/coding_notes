## webpack-dev-server vs react-hot-loader

Both **react-hot-loader** and **webpack-dev-server** are tools that can be used to enable hot reloading in your React application. However, they work differently.

**React-hot-loader** is a library that allows you to see the changes you make in your React components without having to refresh the page. It does this by replacing the old version of the component with the new one. It works by using a combination of Webpack's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) API and Babel.

On the other hand, **webpack-dev-server** is a development server that serves your webpack bundles. It also provides live reloading of your application when changes are made. It does this by watching for changes in your files and then rebuilding your application.

In summary, while both tools allow you to see changes in your React components without refreshing the page, **react-hot-loader** replaces the old version of the component with the new one while **webpack-dev-server** rebuilds your application when changes are made.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
